Starry Homecoming - Static Site
================================

This is a simple, ready-to-deploy static website (HTML/CSS/JS) for a starry-night themed homecoming countdown.
Files included:
- index.html  — main page (editable names, message, upload photo)
- styles.css  — styles and layout
- script.js   — starfield animation, countdown timer, interactions
- her.jpg     — the photo you provided
- starry-homecoming-site.zip — this ZIP (same content)

How to use
----------
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. Open index.html locally in a browser to preview (drag-and-drop or double-click). Note: some browsers restrict reading local files via file input; uploading a photo in the page works.
3. To host online, upload the unzipped files to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, etc.)

Customization
-------------
- Names and message are pre-set in this package (Mili, Avi, and the custom message).
- Change the target date/time using the datetime picker.
- Replace her.jpg if you'd rather use a different default photo.

Questions? If you'd like I can:
- Replace placeholders with exact names/message for you.
- Create a simple GitHub repo and push these files (you'd need to authorize or provide a repo).
- Deploy to a free host and give you a temporary link (I can guide you step-by-step).



Hardcoded values:
- Her name: Mili
- Your name: Avi
- Message: Can't wait to hold you in my arms for real
- Target date/time: 28 Dec 2025 12:00
